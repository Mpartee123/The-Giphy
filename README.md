# The-Giphy
Populate animate and freeze GIFs on this dynamic web page

The setting is the farm of Old MacDonald and sadly there not an animal in sight.

Thankfully you have the power to change that!!

Either click on one of the buttons or create you own with the search buttons to bring
new life to this sad empty farm. 

Once one of the buttons are clicked the farm comes to life with the party animals of the 
Giphy api.

When they appear they will be still but give them a click and the fun really begins!!

Enjoy!
